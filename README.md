# eBNSLNoisyOR
Structure Learning algorithms for Bayesian Networks with Noisy-OR relations.

An effective gradient descent algorithm to score candidate parent sets represented with noisy-OR using the BIC score and with pruning rules that allow structure learning for Bayesian Networks to successfully scale to medium sized networks.

Run ./runScoring to get noisy-OR score files for all nodes.
